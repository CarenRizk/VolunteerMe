This application is user friendly and easy to learn. It allows users to register using their social media accounts. <br />

This AI tool scans the description of the event and users' bio and extracts some keywords from both of them, then it suggest new events for users depending on keywords matching. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _VolunteerMe_ also uses the API of googleMaps to provide users with the exact location for their registered upcoming events. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This service provides organizations with volunteers who are interested in volunteering with them and allows the volunteers to actively contribute to the society by doing something they are interested in.
